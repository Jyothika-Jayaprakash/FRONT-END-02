         <h1> ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE </h1>
         <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence
             displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionally. The distinction between
            the former and the latter catagories is often revealed by the acronym chosen.Colloquially,the 
            term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that
            humans associate with the human mind,such as "learning" and "problem solving".
         </p> 
         <p>As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic
              functions or recognize text through optical character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this
               function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.</p>
